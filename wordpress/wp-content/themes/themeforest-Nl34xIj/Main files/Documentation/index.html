        <p>To employ a widget, simply go to your Widgets editor (located in your WordPress Dashboard in the “Appearance” menu) and drag your widgets into the specified widget areas.</p>

    </section>



    <section id="Updates">

        <h1><a href="#Updates">Updates</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>If you've requested and entered your theme license key, then you'll automatically be notified of any theme updates as we push them. This is the most effective method for getting updates pushed to you quickly and effienctly. </p>

        <h2>Check for Updates</h2>
        <p>To check your theme version, click the live changelog link below and check the version number at the top of the changelog.txt file:</p>
        <p>Relay the changelog version at the top of that changelog.txt file with the version in your WordPress Dashboard > Appearance > Themes section to see if your theme files are up to date.</p>

        <p>If you are in need of the update, download the current build from the location you purchased the theme from ThemeForest to install the updated theme.</p>

        <blockquote>If you have an active license key applied to your theme, you will receive live update notifications to which allows one-click updates directly from your WordPress dashboard.</blockquote>

        <h2>FTP Updating</h2>
        <p>If you have not customized the original theme files then you may simply drop the updated theme folder contents into the theme folder on your server – which is located in wp-content/themes/trobica.</p>
        <p>If you wish to upload the entire updated theme as a separate theme, ensure you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rename the updated theme’s folder (different from the current theme)</li>
            <li>Drop the renamed theme folder into wp-content/themes</li>
            <li>Switch to the new theme via your WordPress Dashboard</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you choose to upload the whole theme and switch to it, you may lose your Theme Customizer data and will have to add those back in.</p>

        <h2>FTP Selective Updating</h2>
        <p>On the other hand, if you have customized some files in the core theme contents, you should consider selective updating, which simply means updating only the files that are pointed out in the theme’s changelog.</p>
        <p>There are a couple programs out there that will allow you to compare versions of files, in order to catch customizations you may not remember. Some recommended programs are <a href="http://winmerge.org/">WinMerge</a> (Windows), <a href="http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/">Kaleidoscope</a> (OSX), and handy GitHub <a href="http://mac.github.com/">(OSX)</a> & <a href="http://windows.github.com/">(Windows)</a>.</p>

        <p>Overall, the safest and cleanest way to update your theme is to leave your currently modified theme on your server/site as is, rename the folder of the newly updated theme, upload the new theme, and modify that to match your original custom work. In this way, if something has gone wrong with the new version, you’re just a few clicks away from getting things back to how they originally were.</p>

        <h1><a href="#ChildTheme">trobica Child Theme</a><small><a href="#html">Back to Top</a></small></h1>
        <p>A child theme is a theme that inherits the functionality and styling of another theme, called the parent theme. Child themes are <b>the recommended way of modifying an existing theme</b>.</p>

        <h2>Why use a Child Theme?</h2>
        <p>There are one main reason why you would want to use a child theme: <b>If you modify a theme directly and it is updated, then your modifications <u>WILL</u> be lost.</b> By using a child theme you will ensure that your modifications are preserved.</p>

        <h2>Installing the Child theme</h2>
        <p>Log in to your site's administration panel, and go to Administration Panels > Appearance > Themes. Click "Add New" and follow the directions to upload the <cite>trobica-child.zip</cite> file, located in the <cite>trobica-package/theme/</cite> folder.</p><p>Next simply click "Activate" and both the trobica theme and trobica child theme will be active on your WordPress site. Now you're ready to customize away.</p>

        <blockquote>Note that this is the same exact method we referred to in the <a href="#GettingStarted">Getting Started</a> section of this guide. You should see your child theme listed and ready for activation.</blockquote>

        <h2>Customizing Template Files</h2>
        <p>If you want to change more than just the stylesheet, your child theme can override any file in the parent theme: simply include a file of the same name in the child theme directory, and <u>it will override the equivalent file</u> in the parent theme directory when your site loads.</p><p>For instance, if you want to change the PHP code for the site header, you can include a header.php in your child theme's directory, and that file will be used instead of the parent theme's header.php.</p>

        <h2>Child Theme Functions.php</h2>
        <p>Unlike style.css, the functions.php of a child theme does not override its counterpart from the parent. Instead, it is loaded in addition to the parent’s functions.php. (Specifically, it is loaded right before the parent’s file.)</p>

        <p>In that way, the functions.php of a child theme provides a smart, trouble-free method of modifying the functionality of a parent theme.</p>

        <h2>Adding PHP Functions</h2>
        <p>Say that you want to add a PHP function to your theme. The fastest way would be to open the trobica /functions.php file and put the function there... <b>But that’s not smart:</b> The next time trobica is updated, your function will disappear (as the entire contents of the /trobica/ folder are replaced upon an update.</p><p>However, there is an alternative way which is the smart way: you can create a child theme, add a functions.php file in it, and add your function to that file. The function will do the exact same job from there too, with the advantage that it will not be affected by future updates of the parent theme.</p>

        <blockquote><b>DO NOT</b> copy the full content of functions.php of the parent theme into functions.php in the child theme. It's not a good practice by any means.</blockquote>
